# TODO

+ Add a (minimal!) package manager?  My model at the moment is vim-plug, but
  I do not want to manage the runtimepath in any way.  Also, I only want to
  use it to install or update via a script.  If that is the case, maybe
  I should write it in Go with a TOML configuration file?
+ Rewrite `ev` and `sv` mappings as commands?  Turn them into `EditVimrc` and
  `SourceVimrc`?
